    About me and this project
    thank:
        nodejs
        meteor
        alertify
        coffeescript
        blade

- Add Icons to: Twitter, Facebook, Google+, VersionEye, Github etc...
- Add a Feedback form
- When deleting technology, delete all it's contribution references as well
- Allow renaming a technology
- Think about a nicer way (visually) to add or edit an aspect contribution
- Allow adding aspects as you want (and suggest some names)
- Add Undo features to deleted items
- Add "I use It" to index page and technology page. For example "I use Java"
- On the server: publish the deleted technologies but only with minimal data, not all data.
- Add DB indices:
    Technologies.name
    Meteor.users.profile.name
    to all IDs laying around (contributionId, aspectId, contributorId etc)
- Add Icons for technologies (see like in versioneye - for java, clojure etc)
- Take care of XSS when inserting HTML to the contribution
- Sanitize H1s etc when adding a contribution

- Make an favicon and a logo file (maybe fiverr)


- Add somehow support for email. Something like - Send to devdev.io (and then have a pending item waiting to be categorized)
- Add a Goodies section with a Bookmaklet and a Chrome/Firefox extension
- Add support for Yassib or just borrow the concepts from it http://www.yasiv.com/github/#/costars?q=meteor%2Fmeteor
- Add typing smartness: /github/user/project, /technology/name, /contributor/name with autocomplete and nice display

- SEO
- Add comparison view
- Add smart texts that allow relationships b/w technologies, such as nodejs requires javascript, v8 etc.
- Draw charts with bubbles according to this model of usage. D3 magic etc.
